After years of failing to track down similar pieces, she decided to make her own, working closely with artisans from Tongyeong, South Korea. In 2017, she produced a collection of richly colored cashmere nubi for Hermès.

(Putnam, $27.) Co-written by the great-grand-nephew of Bram Stoker, this is a fictional prequel to the story of Dracula. Using notes that Stoker himself left (in which he recounted a strange experience with a dark presence), the authors imagine the events that would have led Stoker to compose his tale of the vampire count from Transylvania. LOVECRAFT By H. P. Lovecraft, adapted by I. N. J. Culbard. (SelfMadeHero, $35.) Culbard, a graphic novelist, offers his take on four stories from H. P. Lovecraft, the writer Stephen King called “the 20th century’s greatest practitioner of the classic horror tale.” These stories of madness and surreal worlds are rendered here with the crispness and energy of a comic book. THE VAMPIRE By Nick Groom. (Yale, $25.) Two hundred years after the bloodsucking creature first appeared in literature, Groom presents an authoritative take on the history of the vampire. He tracks its origin to the 18th century and rumors about vampirism that led proponents of the new science to investigate and scrutinize and fantasize about this monster. THE MANSION By Ezekiel Boone. (Emily Bestler/Atria, $26.) A successful programmer decides to resurrect a failed project from his idealistic youth: inventing a computer that can control every function of a house. The only problem is that people keep dying, thanks to the evil in the code. SLUM WOLF By Tadao Tsuge. (New York Review Comics, paper, $22.95.)
